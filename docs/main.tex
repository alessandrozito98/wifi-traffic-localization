\section{Introduction}
This project aims to implement a classification algorithm in the context of Wi-Fi traffic. The classification problem in this context may aid in making more informed decisions in network resource allocation or when performing diagnostics.

The presented pipeline starts with sniffing encrypted Wi-Fi traffic in monitor mode, the subsequent construction of a traffic dataset, and the training of a classifier to distinguish different types of traffic. Finally, we will focus on a single known device, but the procedure can be generalized to many devices contemporaneously. Data analysis was performed with R.

\section{Sniffing and Dataset Building}

\subsection{Sniffing}


The first step in building the dataset is to capture Wi-Fi traffic. We decided to distinguish between five types of traffic:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.3em 
	\item Idle device
	\item Web browsing
	\item VoIP calls 
	\item Video calls 
	\item Youtube streaming
\end{itemize}
We captured (in \textit{monitor mode}) approximately 20 minutes of traffic per type (via Wireshark) and stored them in .pcap files. We filtered traffic sent from and received by the target device\footnote{MAC address A4:42:3B:D2:F7:08}. Since the traffic is encrypted, we cannot rely on port numbers, IP addresses, etc., for the purposes of classification. Instead, we had to work exclusively with statistical features.

\subsection{Dataset Building}

Each entry in our dataset consists of a traffic flow lasting $W$ seconds. This required some preprocessing on the original data. For each traffic flow, which includes all packets sent and received by the target device in the interval $[t, \,t + W)$, we extracted the following statistical features:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.3em 
	\item Mean and variance of packet length
	\item Mean and variance of inter-arrival time
	\item Maximum and minimum packet length
	\item Number of packets of type: QoS Data, QoS Null function, Other
	\item Number of sent and received packets
\end{itemize}


The choice of the parameter $W$ was based on the ability to distinguish the traffic types in that time frame significantly. Starting from 5 seconds and increasing, we finally chose 15 seconds since it met our criteria. So we processed the data to obtain the features and produced a dataset containing 477 rows.


\section{Data Exploration}

We looked at the variance of the features and noticed a significant unbalance (see Figure 1) that we addressed by normalizing the data (see Figure 2). 

\begin{figure}
	\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{boxplot.png}
		\caption{Boxplot of original features, variance of packet length creates an unbalance}
	\end{minipage}
	\hfill
	\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{boxplot2.png}
		\caption{Boxplot of normalized features, our classifier will no longer be biased towards one feature}
	\end{minipage}%
\end{figure}


Because of the high number of features, we performed principal component analysis for visualization purposes. The first three principal components explain over 75\% of the variability. We proceed to assess the separability of the data qualitatively. Figure 3 shows the PC1 v. PC2 plot. Figure 4 shows PC2 v. PC3, which yields similar results.
\begin{figure}

		\includegraphics[width=140mm, height=90mm,scale=0.5]{pc1pc2.png}
		\caption{The PC1 vs PC2 plot shows a significant degree of separability}
\vspace{8mm} 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=140mm, height=90mm,scale=0.5]{pc2pc3.png}
	\caption{Confirms a significant degree of separation in the PC2 v. PC3 plane}
\end{figure}

The plots confirm the presence of well-defined clusters. With this information, we proceed to train the classifier using the original features.

\section{Classification and results}
Many machine learning techniques can tackle this problem: logistic regression, support vector machines, Bayes classifiers, etc. However, we chose $k$-Nearest-Neighbours since the data was well-clustered for it to perform well, and it did not require any strict assumptions on normality and equal variance between clusters. When KNN classifies a new sample, it finds its $k$ nearest neighbors (in the training dataset) and classifies it in the most common class among those neighbors. We used the euclidean distance. We shuffled the data and divided it into a training set (65\%) and a test set (35\%) and tuned the hyper-parameter $k$ via leave-one-out cross-validation. 
\\\\
After finding 6 as our optimal $k$, we proceed to compute the test error\footnote{The test set is normalized using the same normalization obtained from the training set.}. We obtain an accuracy of 88.6\%. Figure 5 shows the confusion matrix, and Figure 6 approximates the classification region. We see that web browsing and idle traffic are difficult to distinguish, whereas video calls are much different from the others; therefore, it is easy to classify them correctly.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

We have reached the goal of classifying traffic with an acceptable level of accuracy. It may be possible to achieve even better results with a further transformation of the original features (use of basis functions) or via kernel functions and support vector machines. In addition, the pipeline can be smoothly adapted into a real-time environment so that we may monitor the state of the network (at least in terms of traffic) and allocate resources accordingly.
